# A-priority-queue-for-a-simplified-agenda-manager-in-a-rule-based-expert-system-shell

**_Objective:_**
To create an application for building a priority queue system that is implemented by using a heap. This agenda manager application should get the input through a file from the user (i.e., user has to provide the absolute file path for the executing to program) and removes out the rule of higher priority after the execution of each and every cycle.
